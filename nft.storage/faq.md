## How can I retrieve my NFT data from NFT.Storage?
We're enhancing data retrieval from NFT.Storage through collaboration with our Storage Providers to facilitate access via ipfs.io, a part of the decentralized IPFS network. This IPFS public gateway is currently under development to support efficient data retrieval. In the meantime, it's accessible for experimental use at ipfs.io/[enter CID].

For less frequent retrievals, get your content directly from the Filecoin storage provider. [Learn more about retrieving from Storage Providers.](https://app.nft.storage/v1/docs/intro)

For more consistent, day-to-day retrieval needs, the IPFS.io gateway may not be suitable due to the varying reliability of this gateway. For a more suitable frequent retrieval use case, we [recommend considering one of these options.](https://nft.storage/blog/onboard-nft-data-to-ipfs)

## Can anyone verify the data stored on NFT.Storage?
All data stored with NFT.Storage is content-addressed with an IPFS hash, allowing anyone to mathematically prove its originality. In addition, periodic cryptographic checks are used in the Filecoin Network, aiming to ensure the verifiability of your data.

## How does NFT.Storage handle data integrity and authencity?
